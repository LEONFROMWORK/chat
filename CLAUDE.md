# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This directory (`/Users/kevin/ttt`) is currently empty and ready for a new project. No existing codebase or project structure has been established yet.

## Getting Started

When initializing a new project in this directory, consider:

1. **For a Ruby on Rails project with Tailwind CSS** (as mentioned in the user's previous context):
   ```bash
   rails new . --css tailwind
   ```

2. **For other project types**, use the appropriate initialization command:
   - Node.js: `npm init` or `yarn init`
   - Python: `python -m venv venv` or `poetry init`
   - Go: `go mod init [module-name]`

## Next Steps

Once a project is initialized, update this CLAUDE.md file with:
- Project-specific build and run commands
- Testing commands
- Code architecture overview
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns


- TEST
