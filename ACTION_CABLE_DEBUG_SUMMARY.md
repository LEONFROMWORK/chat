# Action Cable Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Action Cable Allowed Origins Not Configured**
- **Problem**: Action Cable was rejecting WebSocket connections from localhost:3001
- **Fix**: Added allowed request origins to `config/environments/development.rb`:
  ```ruby
  config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = ['http://localhost:3001', 'ws://localhost:3001', 'http://127.0.0.1:3001', 'ws://127.0.0.1:3001']
  ```

### 2. **Form Submission Intercepted by JavaScript**
- **Problem**: The chat room form had `data-action="submit->chat-room#sendMessage"` which was preventing normal Turbo Stream submission
- **Fix**: Removed the data-action attribute to allow normal form submission via Turbo Stream

### 3. **Duplicate Message Handling**
- **Problem**: Messages were being created through both the channel's `speak` method and the messages controller
- **Fix**: Removed the `speak` method from ChatRoomChannel and the JavaScript, keeping only the messages controller approach

### 4. **Debugging Added**
- Added console.log statements in the JavaScript to track:
  - When ChatRoom controller connects
  - When subscription is created
  - When connected/disconnected from ChatRoomChannel
  - When messages are received via broadcast

## Current Architecture

1. **Message Creation Flow**:
   - User submits form â†’ MessagesController#create
   - Controller saves message and broadcasts to Action Cable
   - Controller responds with Turbo Stream to update sender's view
   - Action Cable broadcasts to all other connected users

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Each user subscribes to ChatRoomChannel when viewing a chat room
   - Broadcasts are sent to all subscribers except the sender
   - Received messages are inserted into the DOM via JavaScript

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the Rails server** (IMPORTANT - to load configuration changes):
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   bin/dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser Developer Console** (F12) to see debug messages

3. **Test with Two Users**:
   - Open two browser windows (use incognito for second)
   - Login as different users in each window
   - Navigate to the same chat room
   - Send a message from one window
   - Verify it appears in the other window without refresh

4. **Check Console for**:
   - "ChatRoom controller connected"
   - "Connected to ChatRoomChannel"
   - "Received broadcast:" messages

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Server not restarted** - Configuration changes require server restart
2. **Not logged in** - Action Cable requires authenticated users
3. **Browser blocking WebSockets** - Check browser console for errors
4. **Different chat rooms** - Ensure both users are in the same room

## Files Modified

- `/config/environments/development.rb` - Added Action Cable allowed origins
- `/app/views/chat_rooms/show.html.erb` - Removed form submission interception
- `/app/javascript/controllers/chat_room_controller.js` - Added debug logging, removed speak method
- `/app/channels/chat_room_channel.rb` - Removed speak method

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. Check Rails logs for Action Cable connection attempts
2. Verify WebSocket connection in browser Network tab (WS filter)
3. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. Ensure cookies are enabled (required for session authentication)
5. Try disabling request forgery protection temporarily:
   ```ruby
   config.action_cable.disable_request_forgery_protection = true
   ```
