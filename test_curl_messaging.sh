echo "✓ Session management works correctly"
echo "✓ Database operations work correctly"
echo "✗ CSRF protection prevents direct curl POST requests"
echo
echo "To properly test with curl, you would need to:"
echo "1. Parse the CSRF token from the HTML response"
echo "2. Include it in your POST request"
echo "3. Maintain session cookies throughout the flow"
echo
echo "For API testing, consider:"
echo "1. Creating an API endpoint that uses token authentication"
echo "2. Temporarily disabling CSRF for specific endpoints (not recommended for production)"
echo "3. Using integration tests within Rails"
